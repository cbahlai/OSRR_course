##Organizing data tables

**Goals for this lesson**

* understand tradeoffs between human and machine readability
* understand some common errors students often make when creating data tables
* never make another terrible data table again


Okay, I know this seems crazy. But I think about data table formatting a lot. I know from lots of personal experience that the single most challenging aspect of a typical workflow in science is getting your stats program to understand what your data are. Working through data formatting problems were the catalyst for me getting into the open science community. 

I think organismal ecologists are often at a disadvantage here. Data formatting and spreadsheet management are *very* rarely explicitly taught, but in many other fields, there is some degree of automation in data collection- machines process the samples and create data tables. But using a few simple guidelines when you design your data tables can save you so, so much time and frustration down the road. 

In this class, we will work through the [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/) lesson on [spreadsheets for ecology](http://www.datacarpentry.org/spreadsheet-ecology-lesson/). A link to a deliciously messy data set is [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5ncuacnd3arjitc/survey_data_tabs.xls?dl=0).
