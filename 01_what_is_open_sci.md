##What is open science?

**Goals for this lesson**

* administrivia! go over the [syllabus](https://github.com/cbahlai/OSRR_course/blob/master/Syllabus.md)
* define open science
* intro to terminology
* Rules and regulations from NSF

This is the first class in the **Open Science and Reproducible Research** course! Welcome! 

We will be using an active learning approach in this course- I will provide you with a series of links/readings/videos that you will be expected to read/skim before class time. Then, we will devote the class time to reviewing, discussing, asking and answering questions, working together on activities, and also using a bit of each class time as a supported work period  on our major project. Generally, Tuesday classes will be about tools, and Thursday classes, we will focus on a more philosophical aspect of open science. For the majority of Thursday classes, I will bring an expert from the Open Science community in by teleconference. We will record those discussions and share them on the web as part of our ongoing effort to create curriculum that can be used for teaching this material to other students- that's right, you're not just a participant of this course, you're also an author!

If you have access to one, please bring a laptop to class. This course is about *doing* open science so the more we can work on in real time, the better. 

Without further ado, let's learn about Open Science!  We will explore the following resources:

Check out this [blog post](https://figshare.com/articles/Open_Research_Glossary/1482094) describing how this glossary came about.
* [Today’s Data, Tomorrow’s Discoveries](http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2015/nsf15052/nsf15052.pdf) NSF's public access plan. This will give us an in-depth look at the changing regulatory landscape around public funding and open data
